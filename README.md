# About This Repository
This Github repository contains :
1. Self Projects- which made by me for exersice and for work
2. University Projects- made by me (and colleagues) for specific courses, seminars etc.

Some of the projects don't contain the dataset (because I couldnt find them..) but the code itself can help understanding my analysis and modeling skills
